## Intro

Hi, I'm an American that lives in Croatia with my wife, Maggie. I've had a huge variety of jobs and lived in a ton of places. I like the Seattle Sounders, dogs (currently owning a Golden named Dina), playing and designing board games, and reading sci-fi. Ask me about US politics :D

I'm a reformed developer. I've also worked in telecom, call centers, and a Mexican bodega. I like double-diamond design. I prefer removable code over expandable code.

I'm an extrovert and a high D ([disc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DISC_assessment)).

## Role

I'm a CTO in residence. My role is to help developers focus on what's important and to help answer technical questions about the product's roadmap.

## Values

- **Speak the truth** even if it's painful.
- **Pay debts owed**, technical and social.
- **Maintain balance:** life and work; wants and needs.
- **Consider your impact**, since everything is connected.
- **Relax** and breathe.

## Successes?

- **Improving processes** - I hate bureaucracy and will do my best to eliminate pointless tasks.
- **Asking questions** - I try to ask questions that make you think. Sometimes I ask questions so that I can learn. It's okay to take time to answer.

## Quirks?

- **Abandoning "the plan"** - I like to have a plan. I like the plan. Sometimes it's hard for me to abandon the plan for a new plan.
- **Lack of recognition** - When someone isn't getting the recognition they deserve, I get upset. I can and should handle this in a less emotional way.
- **Talking too much** - I'm very passionate about some topics and have a tendency to dominate conversation on certain topics.

## Receiving communication

- **Positive** - About right
- **Negative** - I'm sensitive here so please consider understating negative fee

## Favorite treat

Snickerdoodles!
